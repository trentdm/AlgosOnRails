AlgosOnRails
============

Just a simple test playground to familiarize myself with Ruby on Rails, and, time-willing, shore up my experience implementing various algorithms.

I know the two objectives don't really mix, but it seems like a good excuse to familiarize myself with a new dev platform.

ToDo:

- Reflect code for algorithms, rather than copy strings

- Use forms for input and params on algorithms
